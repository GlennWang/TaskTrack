## Creating TaskTrack Database Manually

If TaskTrack fails to create the `tasktrack.db` database automatically, you can follow these simple steps to create it manually:

1. Open the TaskTrack folder using a text editor like VSCode.
2. Within the folder, create a new file.
3. Name the file `tasktrack.db`.
4. Save the file.

Now you have manually created the TaskTrack database and can proceed with using the program.
